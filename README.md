# Chess Hardware Arbiter

This GitHub repository hosts the source code and design files for a hardware-based chess arbitrator built with Arduino. The purpose of this project is to create a reliable and efficient system for validating chess moves in real-time, ensuring that players adhere to the rules of the game.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Move Validation:** The hardware arbitrator, based on Arduino, instantly checks the legality of each move made by players during a chess game.
- **Rule Adherence:** Enforces standard chess rules, including piece movements, castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
- **LED Indicators:** Provides clear visual indicators, such as LEDs, to signal the validity of a move, allowing players to receive immediate feedback.
- **Configurability:** Adaptable to different chess variants and rule sets, making it a versatile solution for various gaming scenarios.
- **Compatibility:** Connects seamlessly with electronic chess boards or interfaces with computer-based chess applications.

## Repository Contents
- **Arduino Firmware Source Code:** The embedded software written in Arduino C++ responsible for move validation.
- **Hardware Design Files:** Schematics, PCB layouts, and component lists for building the chess arbitrator.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation to assist in Arduino setup, hardware assembly, and customization.
